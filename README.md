### A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in go

***

## Running the game
You can download the precompiled executables for:
- Mac OSX
- Windows
- Linux

If you want to compile the game yourself, you can run:
```bash
go get github.com/ludikrous/tictacgo
go run github.com/ludikrous/tictacgo
```

## Contributing
Feel free to create pull requests for the features you'd like to add! 
(Make sure you don't break the game though)

## More about the repo
I built this project to practice using Go - it utilizes structs and packages.
In the future, I might add a GUI and a smarter computer AI.
